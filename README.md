1- Checkout repository: This step checks out the repository's code.

2- Deploy using Docker: This step runs a Docker container using the Ruby 2.7 image. It installs the Shopify Theme Kit gem, updates it, and displays the version of Theme Kit. The environment variables for the Shopify password, store URL, theme ID, and theme path are passed to the container using Docker's -e flag.

3- Deploy Shopify theme using pgrimaud/action-shopify: This step uses the pgrimaud/action-shopify action to deploy the Shopify theme. It requires various environment variables, which seem to be related to different environments and configurations. Here are the environment variables used in this step:


SHOPIFY_PASSWORD: Your Shopify private app password.

SHOPIFY_STORE_URL: Your Shopify store URL.

SHOPIFY_THEME_ID: The theme ID on your Shopify store.

THEME_PATH: The path of your theme in your GitHub repository.

The workflow is designed to deploy your Shopify theme to different environments (staging, preproduction, and production) using the pgrimaud/action-shopify action. It's worth noting that the action is used to deploy the theme to various environments, and the configuration seems to be geared towards handling different stages of development.
